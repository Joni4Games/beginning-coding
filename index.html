      <h1>Introduction to programming</h1>
      <h2>Beginning your journey towards learning to code</h2>
    </hgroup>

<p>Chris Mills, Mozilla</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Our world is becoming increasingly controlled by computers, and you will come into contact with code and computer systems every day, most of the time not even realising it! For many of us, code is like voodoo, or black magic, and this is partially true - complex computer systems require complex code to control them. But understanding the basic principles and building blocks that underpin pretty much all programming languages is well with the grasp of all of us: really! In this course, I will take you gently through all the programming fundamentals you'll need to grasp a working understanding on how code and computer systems work, and even write some simple programs yourself.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a basic course, aimed at people with no previous development/programming experience, which aims to teach the fundamentals of how systems work, and the very basics of how to program.</p>

<p>To take part in this course, you just need access to a computer with a web browser and a text editor installed on it. You don't really need the text editor while you are playing with examples in <a href="http://jsbin.com">JSBin</a> (see <a href="lesson1.html">part 1</a> for more details), but it is a good idea to get acquainted with a text editor before too long.</p>

<p class="note">Note: if you have any feedback or change requests you want to give about the course, send pull requests/comments to the <a href="https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/beginning-coding">Introduction to Coding Github repo, or <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills">send Chris a message on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Resource checklist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>These notes, either in printed or online form. Online is better, as there are a lot of linked resources in here that won't work very well on paper</li>
  <li>A computer with Internet access</li>
  <li>At least one decent web browser installed: Any of the following are ok:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new">Firefox</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari">Safari</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/download">Opera</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie">Internet Explorer (10 or above)</a>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Recommended text editor: Any text editor is ok, as long as it is a pure text editor (Word and Open Office are not appropriate) that supports UTF-8 (NotePad is not ok). <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> has a free trial available, for all platforms, and is excellent. Other free alternatives include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">NotePad++</a> for Windows</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> for Mac</li>
      <li><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">Gedit</a> for Linux.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
